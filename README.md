从我们见面开始，勇敢的去间歇性禁食，让我们一起完成。你能找到辅助APP、方法、成功案例等等，你想要的一切。
目前在间歇性禁食这个领域的资料以及支撑工具都是非常少，单纯从给我个人实践来看效果非常好（一个月配合运动，体脂率降了3%），希望能够帮助到大家。目前初步的规划：间歇性禁食的权威研究成果、成功的案例以及方法、辅助工具（小程序、Web、app）这三大部分，帮助大家给进行间歇性禁食，改善身体指标。
目前的蓝图：优先搜集权威研究资料→完成微信小程序端→完成Web端→完成App端。
采用间歇性禁食的朋友，主要来自于三类人：肥胖人群、需要改善内分泌、好奇宝宝，我们每一步行动需要建立在科学可持续的理论基础或者研究基础之上。因为在创业阶段，每天非常忙，在近期我会尽快完成微信小程序版本，并且将理论资料进行整理，有一个初步的框架。

重要！重要！重要！
郑重声明：本项目仅仅是一个间歇性禁食的开源参考资料，所提供的所有资料以及工具不能作为医疗支持，对任何人不存在任何引导，每个人需要根据自己的身体状况进行谨慎判断，本项目对所有人的健康以及间歇性禁食带来的身体改变不承担任何责任，祝各位身体健康。

Start by meeting us and bravely going on an intermittent fast and let's finish together. You can find supplemental APPs, methods, success stories, etc., everything you want.
There is very little information and support tools available in the field of intermittent fasting, and the results have been very good purely from my personal practice (3% reduction in body fat in one month with exercise). Preliminary planning: the authoritative research on intermittent fasting, success stories and methods, and aids (applet, web, app) to help people perform intermittent fasting and improve their physical indicators.
The current blueprint: priority collection of authoritative research materials → completion of the WeChat applet side → completion of the Web side → completion of the App side.
People who adopt intermittent fasting come from three main groups: obese people, people in need of endocrine improvement, and curious babies, and our every move needs to be based on a scientifically sustainable theoretical basis or research. Because in the startup phase, the day is very busy, in the near future I will finish the WeChat applet version as soon as possible, and put together the theoretical information and have a preliminary framework.

Important! Important! Important!
For the record: this project is only an open source reference for intermittent fasting, all information and tools provided cannot be used as medical support, there is no guidance for anyone, everyone needs to make a careful judgment based on their physical condition, this project is not responsible for the health of everyone and the physical changes brought about by intermittent fasting, good health to all.
